Here's a modified version of the README for your custom Next.js template repository, incorporating the alias you've created:

---

# Next.js Custom Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), enhanced with FontAwesome and React Icons.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project using this template, you can use the following alias for convenience:

```bash
alias nextapp='npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/okeomasilachi/next-temp'
```

Then, to create a new project:

```bash
nextapp my-new-app
```

After setting up your project, navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-new-app
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This template comes pre-configured with the following packages:

- [`@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core)
